# Grammar.Net
Various Grammar Functions as String Extensions

It's only a start, but I'm looking to put various grammatical helpers here in C#

Currently only handles indefinite articles, mainly based on ideas from @rigoneri and @rossmeissl

Working on pluralization and singularization, but it seems that Microsoft already has a great implementation of those in System.Data.Entity.Design.PluralizationServices
SEE: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.data.entity.design.pluralizationservices.pluralizationservice?redirectedfrom=MSDN&view=netframework-4.7.2

# Any ideas welcome!
