# Grammar.Net
String Extensions for Various Grammar Functions

It's only a start, but I'm looking to put various grammatical helpers here in C#

Currently only handles indefinite articles, mainly based on ideas from @rigoneri and @rossmeissl
https://github.com/rigoneri/indefinite-article.js
https://github.com/rossmeissl/indefinite_article

Added work on pluralization and singularization, but it appears Microsoft's System.Data.Entity.Design.PluralizationServices and Humanizer are excellent at that.
Recommend using https://github.com/Humanizr/Humanizer

# Any ideas welcome!
